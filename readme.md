## Setup

We'll be using the version of Tunr that has fully working CRUD functionality.

I'll be adding to the 'Todo' app called [Reminderly](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminderly),
while you'll be working on your Tunr app.

Starter code can be found on the `edit-update` branch of the [tunr features repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/tunr_rails_features/tree/edit-update)
